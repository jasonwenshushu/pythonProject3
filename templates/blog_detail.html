<h2>Ready-made UI components</h2>
<p>Webpixels Components includes over 390 fully responsive HTML components, carefully designed for specific use-cases, like marketing, application/dashboards, and more. All you need to do is to install Bootstrap + Webpixels CSS and start copying the ready-to-use bits of code.</p>
<p>Quickly get a project started with any of our layouts and page examples ranging from using parts of the framework to custom components and layouts. We have plenty of ideas, and in the following weeks, we will release many new components and page categories, like landing, contact, pricing pages, and more.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>Pricing details</h2>
<p>We want to keep our pricing models simple, so we decided to create 3 simple pricing plans to cover most of the use-cases: the Personal, Pro, and Team. It starts from $59 USD/year for one personal project and $99 USD/year for unlimited personal or commercial projects.</p>
<p>Each license is perpetual, meaning that you'll still have a license if you don't renew your paid plan. You'll retain access to the last version available when your plan was active.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for your support on this journey — so happy to see what you think.</p>
